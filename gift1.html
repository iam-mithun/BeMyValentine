     <h1>To My Meshi ❤️</h1>

    <p>
        Meshi…  
        Out of everyone in this world,  
        you are still the one my heart chooses.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are not just someone I love.  
        You are my comfort,  
        my peace,  
        my favorite notification,  
        my safe place.
    </p>

    <p>
        The way you smile,  
        the way you talk,  
        even the way you get angry…  
        everything about you feels special to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are the best thing that ever happened to me.  
        And I mean that with all my heart.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m lucky I met you, Meshi. ❤️
    </p>
